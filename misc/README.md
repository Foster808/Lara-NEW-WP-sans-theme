# What's here

Put any timesaving scripts here

- deploy.sh - a sample RSYNC config for pushing to a staging service
- rsync-exclude - files to avoid syncing

## Notes

Don't actually run these from misc/, copy to the project root and make local
modifications. `deploy.sh` needs edits to work: remove the dry-run flag and
edit paths.
